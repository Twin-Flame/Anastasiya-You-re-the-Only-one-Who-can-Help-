## important.:
A music video directed by Jessie Hill was released on September 11, 2015.[3] Cornell and Eric Roberts play prisoners about to be hanged; as an onlooker (Elena Satine) distracts the hangman, Cornell's noose is sabotaged by the executioner's assistant so he survives his hanging, and is forced into marriage with the woman who sabotaged his hanging. The video ends with the other prisoner about to be hanged and the onlooker about to play her part again. Cornell's 10-year-old son, Christopher, also appears in the video.[4]

Cornell insisted on doing his own stunts and had an accident on set. The shooting of the mock hanging didn't go as planned and they were forced to do it several times. The liquid chemical singeing a noose tied around Cornell's neck rubbed off on his neck, leaving him with second degree burns on his shoulder.[5]

Three weeks after Chris Cornell's suicide by hanging on May 18, 2017, the music video was removed from YouTube.[4]
